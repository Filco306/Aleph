# How to contribute?

If you have an idea, encountered strange behaviour, or a just missing
some functionality, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Pseudomanifold/Aleph/issues)
n the project's issue tracker.

Since this project is not really large, there are no coding conventions.
If you want to make me happy, just emulate my coding style. If you don't
like my coding style, I will just refactor your code prior/after
pulling. Let's be excellent to each other!
